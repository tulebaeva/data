17,04 16 93 1045 ARMENIA SAYS IT COULD SHOOT DOWN TURKISH PLANES By David Ljunggren MOSCOW April 16 Reuter Armenia accused Turkey on Friday of flying weapons x and troops across Armenian airspace to Azerbaijan and strongly hinted it might try to shoot the planes down local journalists in Yerevan said Separately Itar Tass news agency said Armenian forces had halted their latest offensive which has swallowed up one tenth of Azerbaijan and sent tensions in the Transcaucasian region soaring The journalists in the Armenian capital quoted Armen Duliyan head of the Armenian defence ministry press centre as saying Ankara had been sending planes up to 15 times a day to Azerbaijan with arms and troops It looks as though the Armenian leadership will have to warn Turkey about the impermissibility of such actions the journalists quoted Duliyan as saying If such steps are pursued in the future we will have recourse to appropriate measures We have all the necessary means including modern anti aircraft units Turkey which shares a border with Armenia has supported Azerbaijan in the conflict over the mainly Armenian populated Nagorno Karabakh region in which more than 2 500 people have been killed since fighting erupted in 1988 The Turkish foreign ministry said on Friday it had so far sent one plane to Azerbaijan containing humanitarian aid A Turkish foreign ministry spokesman on Thursday would not ment directly on a report by Hurriyet newspaper that a first consignment of rockets rocket launchers ammunition and light weapons had arrived in Azerbaijan from Turkey Duliyan said Turkey had been sending up to 30 trucks a day carrying troops and arms to the bordering Azeri autonomous territory of Nakhichevan from where they were flown across Armenian airspace to the Azeri capital Baku All the responsibility for possible consequences will be borne by the country which is affording military assistance over our airspace he said Armenia denies any formal role in the conflict saying that the troops involved in the fighting are from the enclave itself Tass said the Karabakh forces decided on Friday to suspend their offensive along the entire Armenian Azerbaijani front The Karabakh authorities are reportedly ready to give independent inspectors a chance to see for themselves on the spot that the enclave s leadership is striving to achieve a ceasefire the agency said Armenian President Levon Ter Petrosyan called for a two stage ceasefire in Karabakh when he arrived in the Belarus capital Minsk on Friday for a summit of Commonwealth leaders The first stage of the settlement should involve a ceasefire and securing the protection of the Karabakh population Tass quoted him as saying At least 10 ceasefires have been brokered in the conflict but all have collapsed The second stage should involve discussing and finding a solution to the legal issues that is a clarification of the status of Nagorno Karabakh he said The republic declared full independence last year but the move has not been recognised by any other country Armenia insists that a separate Karabakh delegation should take part in future peace talks something Azerbaijan rejects Local news agencies in Baku said on Friday that Interior Minister Iskender Gamidov a fiery nationalist and hardliner in the territorial dispute with Armenia had resigned Turan news agency said he quit on Thursday and had cleared his office Khabar Servis agency said he would be replaced by the military mandant of Baku police Major General Abdullah Allakhverdiyev There was no official confirmation David Davidian dbd urartu sdpa How do we explain Turkish troops on S D P A Center for Regional Studies the Armenian border when we can t P O Box 382761 even explain 1915 Cambridge MA 02238 Turkish MP March 1992

16, In article CMM 0 90 2 735132009 thomasp surt ifi uio no Thomas Parsli thomasp ifi uio no writes Gun clubs If you are a member you CAN borrow weapons Suprised You are supposed to train with a 22 for the 6 months THEN you can start with anything bigger Drivers licence F ot that USA is THE land of cars Getting one in Scandinavia and northern europe is not easy Average time is about 20 hours of training and the cost is rather But we think this is acceptable because a car is NOT a toy and bad drivers tend to hurt OTHERS If you are really bad you WON T get a lincence Abuse by the goverment This seems to be one of the main problems Any harder gun control would just be abused by the goverment Either some of you are a little paranoid no offence OR you should get a new goverment You do have elections Unfortunately elections can and are bought Promise the voters money and they will vote for you Guns n Criminals MOST weapons used by criminals today are stolen Known criminals can NOT buy weapons that s one of the points of gun control Same here Convicted felons may not legally purchase firearms And because gun control are strict in WHOLE scandinavia and most of europe we dont have any PROBLEM with smuggled guns That you know of While I lived in the DBR a gang robbed a joint US Army Bundewehr armoury and got several hundred M 16s ammunition handguns and some explosives When I left two years later there were no clues Mixing weapons and things that can be use as one What I meant was that cars CAN kill but they are not GUNS Someone said that if we ban guns we d have to ban cars to because they kill to I don t think we should argue on this one The issue I hope I think we all agree that the criminals are the main problem Guns are not a problem but the way they are used is and what are they for Who uses them is the problem Crime in the U S is no big deal if you are the criminal How about 5 years for murder Credit for time served in jail waiting for trial and you are out in 12 months worst case If we would put criminals especially violent ones in the slam for true sentences crime would drop Instead we reward them for being good and let them out early very early I think this discusion is interesting when you think of ex Jugoslavia They should all have weapons it s their rigth to have them and if they use them to kill other Innocent people the problem is humans not guns Serbs Croats and Muslims have been killing each other almost since before the invention of guns Old women are throwing stones at UN trucks This is a hatred that goes beyond reason If 50 of ALL murders was done with axes would you impose some regulations on them or just say that they are ment to be used at trees and that the axe is not a problem it s the axer An example don t flame me just because not exactly 50 are killed by guns Yes the problem is the user Question back since you are one of the rational ones If all gun crime were to stop would you support dropping all gun controls Think about the situation in Los Angeles where people are buying guns to protect themselves Is this a good situation Is it the rigth way to deal with the problem They did not believe from experience that the police including National Guard could would protect them Unless you want to argue that a human being does not have a right to protect him herself they did the right thing What would you suggest as a defense against a mob throwing bottles and rocks and also likely armed with stolen firearms If everybody buys guns to protect themselves from criminals and their neighbor who have guns what do you think will happen I mean if everybody had a gun in USA Criminals would move to Scandinavia The average criminal would look for a less hazardous job and the rest would likely be buried at county expense Don t flame the Englishmen because of Northern Irland they have gun control that works in England and fonds from USA are one of the reasons why IRA can bomb innocents Something about throwing stones in glass houses Personally I criticize the fools who send money to the IRA to make Ireland free Of course this is the last thing the IRA wants because they lose power if England pulls out But that s for another group Don t flame them because of what to three children did either The U S has roughly 20 times the major sporting events as the U K How many riots did we have at sporting events last year off the playing field Hooligan is a word never used when reffering to sports fans here I guess that s where the different cultures thing es in Can an Jugoslav have an oppinion on guns or even peace YES Yes The question is is the problem one of too many guns mostly from the army or not enough nonSerbians can not defend themselves My numbers about crime rates after restrictions on shot guns are from the police and the Statistisk Sentralbyraa understood that one Sorenson LAST WORD Responsible gun owners are not a problem but they will be affected if you want to protect your

10, Dean J Falcione posting from jrmst 8 pitt writes I wrote When the Pens got Mario granted there was big publicity etc etc and interest was immediately generated Gretzky did the same thing for LA However imnsho neither team would have seen a marked improvement in attendance if the team record did not improve In the year before Lemieux came Pittsburgh finished with 38 points Following his arrival the Pens finished with 53 76 72 81 87 72 88 and 87 points with a couple of Stanley Cups thrown in It was at this point the Pens attendance was near capacity 34 out of 40 sellouts yet they hadn t made the playoffs since 1982 How do you explain a 6th place team breaking attendance records when they haven t been to the playoffs in 7 years Mario Lemieux is the explanation IMHO You could make a case that the expectation of an improving team that would make the playoffs is the reason Funny you should mention it this is exactly the case I was going to make But I think the reason is Lemieux had a 168 point season and was the first non Gretzky to win the Hart and Ross since 1980 People turned out to watch him play I will grant that a star like Mario will draw fans even if the team sucks But this is short term only I still do not think the attendance increase will last unless the team is a winning petitive improving butt kicking one Pittsburgh was still getting better so people continued to support them If they suddenly dropped to say 50 points you d have knee surgery for some of the people jumping off the bandwagon Also the following year 88 89 the Pens had 89 points not 87 Ok My numbers came from the NHL Guide and Record Book They made the transaction to try and build a winner around Mario that is true But the improvement in attendance came before they started doing this Coffey late in 1987 and before they even had a playoff bound team A doubling of attendance occured in 1984 85 from the previous year An increase from 38 points to 53 points is not going to do that The arrival of Mario Lemieux is what did it You can give the credit to Mario since he deserves it But my point is that it wasn t Mario himself but it was the expectation of things to e i e a winning team that he created by being the next great hockey superstar And before anybody jumps in and says I m nit picking and mincing words go back and read from where this thread started It might help to think about what would go through a fan s mind who suddenly found an interest in Mario and the Pens Was it gee Mario Lemieux is amazing I ll go watch him play or was it gee now we ve got a kick ass guy on our side I ll go watch him play I think it was the latter Similar thing happened in L A Before Gretzky s arrival about 12000 per game After constant sellouts They are STILL selling out every game despite showing little or no improvement since Gretzky s first year there How do you explain it People are going to see Gretzky they certainly aren t going to see a winner they haven t GOT a winner They ve had MUCH better teams in their past history than they currently have yet they didn t draw as well then I don t think this is accurate The tickets sell but people don t go to the games I think this thread has already been discussed season ticket holders in LA don t always use their tickets So in effect after the Kings initial success following Gretzky s arrival 68 to 91 points same source and corresponding attendance jump there has been an effective drop in attendance even though ticket sales may not have changed much Whether or not the Kings are a winner is debatable I claim that since Gretzky s arrival they have at the very least been petitive I also claim that McNall has made a stupid move in trying to reassemble the Oiler dynasty but that s another story and included only because I don t like McNall Anyway McNall did do some heavy marketing around Gretzky and that undoubtedly was also responsible for the attendance and merchandising sales etc But as I said when the Kings have been in there little tailspins over the past couple of years there have been empty seats at the Forum even if the tickets were sold I think in the case of a Lemieux or Gretzky the player can transcend winning as the major drawing power For the short term IMO Although I think that it s inevitable that the team will improve with a player such as Lemieux or Gretzky simply because they make people around them better But winning sure as hell helps Well at least we are in full agreement here This does not make Roger s point any more valid but the Jets aren t So are you saying Roger has ever had a valid point couldn t resist getting a HUGE jump in productivity yet they ARE getting a huge jump in attendance This is due to the emergence of Teemu Selanne They have the 17th best record in hockey it sure as hell isn t because they are winning Yes but they are doing no worse than last year I think the same type of reasoning I applied to a new Pittsburgh fan applies to all the extra people showing up at Winnipeg games It s difficult to predict but do you think that if the Jets miss the playoffs next season that in the year after they will maintain their attendance levels I seriously doubt it because in that case the expectation of an improving team would be gone with or without Selanne I did provide the example of Rocket Ismail and the Toronto Argonauts of the CFL did you leave it out because you don t know much about the CFL If that s the case then fair enough but if it isn t the case then I m curious to hear your explanation

to do anything But Christians have a criterion to use for making our judgments on this the Great Commandment of love for God and neighbor If you cannot go through Leviticus and decide each mand there on that basis then your own arbitrary selection from it is simply idiosyncracy In this context it is remarkably offensive to say I notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows the verse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual intercourse I am sorry you found this offensive It was not my intent to offend I was leading up to another point which I discuss in more detail below Well la ti da So what This is almost as slimey an argument as the one that homosexuality rape I know of no one who argues seriously though one can always find jokers in defense of bestiality It is absolutely irrelevant and in parable to the issues gay Christians do raise which concern sexual activity within mitted consensual human adult realtionships so that your bringing it up is no more relevant than the laws of kashrut If you cannot address the actual issues you are being bloody dishonest in trailing this red herring in front of the world If you want to address bestiality that is YOUR business not mine And attempting to torpedo a serious issue by using what is in our culture a ridiculous joke shows that you have no interest in hearing us as human beings You want to dismiss us and use the sleaziest means you can think of to do so I can see you have a revulsion for bestiality that far exceeds my distaste for homosexuality Certainly if I spoke about homosexuality the way you speak of bestiality nobody would have any trouble labelling me a homophobe Let me ask this gently why are you so judgemental of other people s sexual preferences What happened to No doubt I am free to do anything I think you have a serious double standard here When you describe a parison between homosexuality and bestiality as slimey and sleazy you are making an implicit judgement that bestiality is perverted sinful disgusting unnatural in short all the things that society once thought about homosexuality Not all people share your view You claim not to know any sincere zoophiles but this does not mean that they do not exist They even have their own newsgroup alt sex bestiality Are you going to accuse them all of being mere jokers I notice you deleted the main point of my ment the fact that the only Biblical condemnations of bestiality occur in connection with the Levitical prohibitions against homosexuality While there are some New Testament passages that can arguably be taken as condemning homosexuality there are none that condemn bestiality One of your main points seems to be that Christian homosexuality is acceptable due to the lack of any clear New Testament statements against it if this is a valid argument then should not Christian zoophilia be made that much more acceptable by the fact that the New Testament makes no reference clear or unclear to the subject at all I am quite serious here If I am going to accept homosexuality as Biblically acceptable on the basis of your arguments then I am going to be fair and apply the same standards to everyone else s declared sexual preferences as well If the arguments you make for homosexuality can be applied to other sexual preferences as well I m going to apply them and see what es up I m not trying to torpedo a serious issue by using what you label a ridiculous joke I posted a question about how we should interpret Biblical guidelines for Christian sexuality and I don t think such a question is irrelevant in a group called soc religion christian The Bible discusses homosexuality and bestiality together in the same context and therefore I feel I have a good precedent for doing the same Jesus and Paul both expound very explictly and in considerable length the central linch pin of Christian moral thought we are required to love one another and ALL else depends on that Gay and lesbian Christ ians challenge you to address the issue on those terms and all we get in return are cheap debate tricks attempting to side track the issues I don t know whether it makes any difference but for the record this is not a side issue for me I believe loving one another includes not encouraging people to defile themselves therefore it is of high importance to determine whether God regards certain sexual acts as defiling I can read in the New Testament that God has joined together heterosexual couples and that the marriage bed is undefiled I can read in the Old Testament that homosexual intercourse and bestiality defile a person whether or not that person is under the Law If gay Christians can validly put aside the Old Testament standards of defilement then I want to know so that I can fairly apply it to all the sexual practices that defiled a person in the old days I don t think it s right to take just bits and pieces of the Law and try and apply them to Christians today e g bestiality still defiles you but homosexuality doesn t That was pretty much what you said earlier right You used different examples but I think you said essentially the same thing about it being wrong to apply only certain parts of the Law to Christians Christians no doubt very sincere ones keep showing up here and in every corner of USENET and the world and ALL they ever do is spout these same old verses which they obviously have never thought about maybe never even read in TOTAL ignorance of the issues raised slandering us with the vilest charges of child abuse or whatever their perfervid minds can manage to conjure up tossing out red herrings with they suppose great emotional force to cause readers to dismiss our witness without even taking the trouble to find out what it is It was not my intent to stir up such an emotional reaction I personally don t get all that upset discussing alternatives to the monogamous heterosexual orientation I m afraid I naively assumed that others would have a similar attitude Please note that I have never intended to equate homosexuality with child abuse I have merely noted that for all the lack of clear NT condemnation of homosexuality there is an even greater lack of NT condemnation or even mention of bestiality a practice which a number of people e g on alt sex bestiality consider to be their true sexual orientation Such behavior should shame anyone who claims to have seen Truth in Christ WHY for God s precious sake do you people quote irrelevant verses to condemn people you don t know and won t even take the trouble to LISTEN to BEFORE you start your condemnations Is that loving your neighbor God forbid Is THAT how you obey the repeated mands to NOT judge or condemn others Christ and Paul spend ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE more time in insisting on this than the half dozen obscure words in Paul that you are SO bloody ready to take as license to do what God tells you NOT to do Why for God s sake quote from John 3 17ff omitted for brevity This is an excellent question and I pray that you will not treat it as a mere rhetorical question but will genuinely seek to discover and understand the answer I re mend you begin with a little introspection into why you yourself have much the same attitude towards zoophilia Why do you find bestiality so repugnant that you regard it as slanderous to even mention in connection with other alternative sexual orientations Why do you not apply all the same verses about love and tolerance to zoophiles the way you apply them to homosexuals Is it because you automatically experience a subjective feeling of revulsion at the thought A lot of people have the same experience at the thought of homosexual intercourse Is it because you regard the practice as socially unacceptable A lot of people regard homosexuality as socially unacceptable Do you feel that it violates the traditional Judeo Christian standard of sexual morality Many people feel that homosexuality does Do you feel the Bible condemns it Many people think the Bible says more to condemn homosexuality than it does to condemn bestiality Why then do you think paring bestiality with homosexuality is insulting to homosexuality If you can honestly answer this question you will have e a long way towards understanding why many people feel the same way about homosexuality as you feel about bestiality Also please note that I am not in any sense condemning people I am merely pointing out that when I read the Bible I see certain sexual practices that the Bible appears to condemn e g sex outside of marriage When I say I think adultery and pre marital sex are sinful do you take that as me failing to love my neighbor When you treat bestiality as something disgusting and unmentionable are you disobeying repeated orders not to judge or condemn others When you say other Christians are guilty of sinning by condemning you and judging you are you by that accusation making yourself guilty of the same offense Or are you and I both simply taking note about practices the Bible brands as sinful and leaving the judgement of the people up to God For long ages we many of us have been confused by evil counsel from evil men and told that if we came to the light we would be shamed and rejected Some of us despaired and took to courses that probably do show a sinful shunning of God s light Blessed are those whose spirits have been crushed by the self righteous they shall be justified However we have seen the Truth and the Truth is the light of humanity and we now know that it is not WE who fear the light but our enemies who fear the light of our witness and will do everything they can to shadow it with the darkness of false witness against us Michael L Siemon I say You are gods sons of the mls panix Most High all of you nevertheless or you shall die like men and fall mls ulysses att like any prince Psalm 82 6 7 I m not sure what you mean by the above two paragraphs If you mean that Jesus is the Truth and that He accepts sinners and does not reject them then I agree If we were not sinners then we would not need a Savior Our salvation in Christ however does not mean that sin is now irrelevant for us and we can now do whatever we want Nor does Christ s grace mean that those who refer to sin as sin are being judgemental or intolerant I am speaking in general terms here not specifically about homosexuality If the Bible calls something sin then it is not unreasonable for Christians to call it sin too As applied to Christian homosexuality I think the only definitive authority on Christian sexuality is the Bible If you make a list of everything the Bible says on the subject of homosexual intercourse I think you will find that every verse on the list is negative and condemning at worst and unclear at best The most pro gay statement you could make about the list is that there is some dispute about the New Testament verses which many people interpret as condemning homosexual intercourse That is from a gay perspective the most positive thing you can say about the Bible s treatment of homosexuality is that some verses fail to clearly condemn it That s it Jesus declared all foods clean the council at Jerusalem declared that Gentiles were not required to keep the ritual Law but nobody ever reclassified homosexual intercourse from being an abomination deserving of death to being an accepted Christian practice You have verses describing homosexual intercourse as an abomination that defiles both Jews under the Law and Gentiles not under the Law and you have some verses which are at best not clear but which some people believe are clear in their condemnation of homosexual behavior and that s the sum total of what the Bible says about same sex intercourse I can appreciate from personal experience your desire to have everything simple cut and dried black and white what I want is ok and those who oppose me are wicked However I do not think the Bible makes your case as definitively as you would like it to In fact I don t believe it says anything positive about your case at all Yes I know the verses about loving one another and not judging one another but that s not really the issue is it You know and admit that there are still things that are sinful for Christians to do since you say it is wrong for Christians to condemn you Therefore the issue is whether the Bible says homosexual intercourse is a sin Even if you do challenge the clarity of the New Testament verses you are still left with the fact that the only thing the Bible does say clearly about homosexual intercourse is that it is an abomination that defiles both those who are under the law and those who are not Mark Actually I don t think the reaction to the parision with bestiality is based on bestialophobia I think what he regards as slimey is the rhetorical approach of connecting homosexuality and bestiality Most people who accept homosexuality take a radical approach to the Law They regard all of Lev as not binding on Christians The argument is that there s no way in the text to separate bestiality homosexuality and wearing mixed fabrics This does not mean that such people have no limits on their conduct nor does it mean that they accept bestiality It simply means that their sexual ethics does not e from the Law and particularly not from Lev clh

prevented them from ing out with their hands up while national tv cameras watch Watch from where Two miles away Far enough away that whatever really happenned must be explained through the vengeful filter of a humiliated agency that said quote Enough is enough Please tell me what you think would have happened had the people e out with their hands up several weeks ago It didn t happen And who is responsible for it not happening Certainly not the children Koresh was calling the shots He was talking with his lawyer and the FBI Since others were released safely there is no sane reason for keeping the children inside the pound The FBI and Koresh were calling the shots And there were very sane reasons for keeping the children if they let them go the parents would NEVER see them again That is not an easy choice in spite of you cold attitude about it scenario that is simplest and most plausible I do not generally believe in conspiracy theories that involve plicated and unlikely scenarios The FBI sent letters to Martin Luther King s wife insinuating that MLK was having an affair Again please tell us exactly how much you trust our supposedly benevolent government More than someone who would not release children from the pound Obviously You are an authority worshiper Not at all Are you a Koresh worshiper I am a constitution worshiper You quite obviously eat anything the authorities feed you without doubt which makes you no different that a Koresh worshiper I e more than David Koresh Vernon Howell Jesus Christ I saw lengthy excerpts from an Australian documentary made in 1992 that clearly showed that this was a cult Give me a camera and time with you and I can present excerpts that show you to be a cult leader Guarenteed Thanks for my laugh of the day Definitely a very silly supposition If you do not believe this you are truly naive It is not only possible it is easy I worked in the broadcast profession at a network station in the late 70s I know what I m saying here Embarrasing footage is easy to get add a little sinister music and the right voice over and I ll have you mother agreeing to mit you You should at least view the whole documentary before you claim it as a source I would if I could The news show that showed the lengthy excerpts also had interviews with the filmmaker who made the documentary who basically confirmed what was shown in the excerpts from the time he spent at the pound in 1992 The news shows were looking for excerpts which backed their position Do you think they would show excerpts which disproved their points I am not pleased with the BATF handling of the affair I think they bungled it badly from the start But I don t think they are responsible for the fire which started in two different places Two places eh You saw this Or did the wonderful FBI tell you this I saw one place I believe that this was reported by local radio reporters on site A fire started in a three story tower at the same time as the two story window shown on the tv coverage The reports of multi starts came solely from the FBI Anyone observing the fire from the available video would be hard pressed to see more than one point of fire Which spread across the pound as a uniform rate The BATF is by no means devoid of fault in the handling of this affair But to suggest that they may have intentionally started the fire is ludicrous I suspect that there were plenty of camerapeople willing to risk small arms fire to get some good footage These people were told to get the hell out of camera range Why Couldn t answer this one eh This is the most important question of all it is the root cause of all the other suspicion I thought about mentioning how Reagan and the military treated the press in Grenada and how that set the precedent but decided it wasn t worthy of discussion If the news reporter got shot you can bet his family would sue the government for letting him into the danger area No reported has ever sued the government for such a situation They know the dangers Remember the BATF invited the initial coverage And how about a simple remote controlled camera or two There were ways to provide media access The FBI obviously just didn t want any The root cause of suspicion in my mind is why 100 people wouldn t flee a building that had numerous exits during the 30 minutes time it took to burn down Or why didn t they flee hours earlier when the tear gas was first introduced I can find no rational explanation for their behavior I can find several Tear gas and smoke making it impossible to remove the barricades Flames blocking exits to the saferooms Perhaps the gun shots were from the FBI keeping them pinned in Who knows Jim jmd handheld I m always rethinking that There s never been a day when I haven t

16,I wrote Nice strawman indeed The discussion is not about whether there were tanks used in sixties riots instead it is about whether those tanks fired their main guns in one of those riots You claim they did That claim is ludicrous Awesley replied I repeated what I had been told under what context I had heard it supporting the claim that tanks were indeed used in Detroit in 67 The issue has never been whether tanks were used in Detroit in 1967 It has been whether they fired their main guns You did not merely claim that tanks were used you claimed that they fired their main guns to suppress sniper fire and that they were quite effective at this You continue to back away from this claim and defend something else that nobody is disputing Awesley went on I spent a few minutes in a library today found their puter was down and they don t have a card catalog Anyway it took about 10 minutes to find this in Nightmare in Detroit A Rebellion and It s Victims by Sauter and Hines on page 133 telling of the death of Tonia Blanding age 4 When the tank was fired upon by snipers it turned in the direction the shots came from the fifty caliber machine gun mounted on the tank belched fire into the buildings After a short round into the front of the buildings the tank guns spit again tearing apart huge holes out of the side of the apartment Well it s not the main gun Well it s not the main gun Gee that s only the entire point Are you now going to admit that you were wrong I wrote will I see any pictures of tanks firing their main guns Will I see pictures of buildings damaged by the shells Will I read the reports of the tank fire I ll bet you dollar to doughnuts I won t It will take more than second hand accounts from a few old National Guard sergeants shooting the shit to convince me that tanks shelled American cities in the Sixties Awesley replied Well if you bothered to read them it wouldn t take long at all to find reports of tank fire although not necessarily of the main guns I will never read of tanks firing their main guns in Detroit in the 67 riots There is simply no way that such an event could have taken place without it being mon knowledge even 26 years later The American military firing shells from tanks in American cities on blacks would have been big news Awesley goes on You can also read of the troops using grenade launchers To fire fragmentary grenades I doubt that as well To fire concussion grenades Perhaps To fire tear gas Certainly But you would be perfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags wouldn t you since it makes your other claim seem more plausible And on I don t expect to convince you you ll have to open your mind and eyes and actually do a little research to be convinced one way or the other Let me know what you find I already know what you found nothing If I claimed that the Marines used F 4s to launch rockets at buildings in Trenton New Jersey would you believe me Would you suspend judgment until you had a chance to research it Or would your bullshit filters kick in If tanks had fired their main guns in Detroit people would have been screaming about it for the past two and half decades I would know about it Unless you also claim that the National Guard managed to cover it up If your mind is open enough to believe that well good for you I prefer to live in reality And here in reality I find it hard to believe that those tanks even had any shells much less fired them John L Scott

17,In article 13MAY93 02285380 edison usask ca f54oguocha edison usask ca writes please don t be offended at this question Who are the Muslims in the Bosnian context Bosnian Muslims are citizens od Bosnia Herzegovina who identify themselves with Bosnian Muslim cultural and religious tradition i know that a moslem muslim is a believer in Islam Islam is a religion and it is practised in many parts of the world But it is not yes definitely not an ethinic group ok so these Bosnian Muslims who are they to which ethnic group do they belong what language s do they speak do they have a different language from that of the Serbs or Croats In Bosnia Muslim is not merely a religious category but an ethnic one as well Actually here are the two contradictory arguments made by people on this subject 1 There is only Serbian and Croatian nationality and Bosnian Muslims are simply Croats and Serbs of Islamic faith 2 Bosnian Muslims are a separate nationality since they do not feel themselves to be Croats nor Serbs In 1968 argument 2 was accepted by former Yugoslavia as valid and 1 was soundly rejected The reasons are pragmatic even if Bosnian Muslims are Croats and Serbs who converted to Islam under Turkish rule centuries ago none of the present generation has any clue what was their ancestor s actual nationality In fact although Bosnian Muslims have felt drawn to Croatian or Serbian national allegiance most of them feel they have a separate cultural and historic identity So arguments like yes but your ancestors were Croats or Serbs carry very little weight Regardless of what their ancestors might have been as long as Bosnian Muslims feel that they are a separate national group that ends the debate What outsiders say is simply not relevant the way the western press use the word muslim in this Bosnian debacle has kept me wondering when the meaning of muslim moslem i knew from childhood was changed in the dictionary this is just a question no flames intended In the case of former Yugoslavia the date is 1971 when Muslim nationality appeared as a census category for the first time This was the result of a sequence of decisions over the past decade from recognizing Bosniaks as an ethnic group 1961 to February 1968 resolution in B H declaring that Muslims are a separate nation to formal endorsement of this in January 1969 and eventually to the 1971 inclusion of Muslim nationality choice in census forms For parison in 1948 census there were three national categories available to Muslims in Bosnia Herzegovina Serb Muslims 71 991 Croat Muslims 25 295 Muslims ethnically undeclared 788 403 This clearly demonstrates that Muslims feel themselves to be their own nationality Only a tiny minority felt able to choose Serb or Croat nationality Census results show that Bosnian Muslims have consistently opted for a third category in 1948 they chose undeclared in 1953 they chose Yugoslavs in 1961 both Yugoslavs and Bosniak ethnic group and in 1971 1981 and 1991 they chose Muslim nationality Perhaps the term Bosnian Muslim nationality is too confusing for the rest of the world But in the present context we ARE talking about Muslims as nationality not as a religous group within some separate national identity The reasons are mostly historical and cultural Religion plays a smaller role as a part of culture in general because the area is simply not known for religious fanaticism Political fanaticism yes religious fanaticism no Group security and survival dominate people s thinking not fine points of theology In fact Bosnia Herzegovina is as well known for religious tolerance in peacetime as it is known for terrible carnage in wartime Sincerely Josip

16,In article 1qmuv8INNl8s dns1 NMSU Edu loki acca nmsu Entropic Destroyer writes The following is quoted from the tail end of a rather condescending article about Paxton Quigley that appeared in US Snooze and World Lies sorry i think it was in the wall street journal and was repeated in the Colorado people s Daily a student newspaper at the University of Colorado at Boulder A study of residential gunsot deaths in King County Wash found that a gun in the home was 43 times more likely to be used to kill its owner spouse a friend or child than to kill an intruder The used to kill is the heart of the misinformation It s one of those technically accurate phrasings that conveys the wrong impression What Mr Quiqley is more than aware of I m sure is that when people read this they think violent arguments where one member of the family grabs a gun and shoots another thereby creating a tragic situation which could easily have been avoided had the gun not been there or a tragic accident especially involving a child Unfortunately that s not the way things stack up The majority of that 43 times 37 I believe are suicides That is someone intentionally took a firearm and shot themselves intending to kill themselves And why it s popular to try and blame suicides on guns the evidence doesn t support this Internal studies as well as parative studies with other countries indicate that cultural factors far outweigh whether a person will kill themselves or not Japan for instance has a slightly higher rate than the U S There people jump off buildings According to the National Crime Survey 40 of violent crime is mited by non strangers which mistakenly has been generalized regarding the King County study to mean Friends and family That is Mr Quigley and others who quote this statistic are banking on the mental image that a Friend family member or child equates to a loving relationship and that it was cut short in a moment of anger Unfortunately all too often husbands beat and kill wives children assault parents or vice versa Most rapes are mited by someone known to the victim for instance Essentially that a gun was used against a friend or family member doesn t mean they weren t trying to hurt the other person Crime is highest among poor urban families and those are also the areas most at risk for family problems especially violent ones A son in a gang may not be as loving toward his parents if they disapprove than a suburban kid might Finally it hinges on the fallacy that a dead intruder is the only value of a self defense firearm Using the minimum figures I worked out using the NCS I got about an 80 1 ratio between deadly self defenses justifiable homicides and with gun self defenses Between the FBI Uniform Crime report and the NCS there s an enormous amount of data and anybody with the calculator can crunch the numbers As such it is incorrect to assume that a dead body is the only valid means of determining the success of such a defense since according to the NCS which has been considered by many to seriously under report defenses there were far more successful with gun defenses than intruders killed Not it also confines itself to the home where attack by a friend or family member is far far more likely and excludes any defense which occurs outside the home I believe a large number occur in businesses Studies by the Western Psychiatric Institute in Pittsburgh found that the mere presence of a gun in the home sharply incresases the likelihood a family member will mit suicide even in the absence of psychiatric illness I have not seen the exact data for this so I can t ment I will point out Canada s and Japan s suicide rate as indications that culture far more than firearm availability affect suicide rates There was also a parative study between Canada for what it s worth considering the difficulty of paring across cultural lines published in the New England Journal of Medicine I can get the exact cite if you need it that concluded that restrictive firearm laws would not significantly impact the over all suicide rate David Veal Univ of Tenn Div of Cont Education Info Services Group PA146008 utkvm1 utk I still remember the way you laughed the day your pushed me down the elevator shaft I m beginning to think you don t love me anymore Weird Al

not apply to you In general however systems connected to the net fall in one of three categories Internet Usenet or BITNET Electronic mail may be sent between these networks and other resources available on one of these networks are sometimes accessible from other networks by email sent to special servers The space and astronomy discussion groups actually are posed of several mechanisms with mostly transparent connections between them One mechanism is the mailing list in which mail is sent to a central distribution point which relays it to all recipients of the list In addition to the general lists for space called SPACE Digest for Internet users and SPACE on BITNET there are a number of more specialized mailing lists described below A second mechanism is Usenet netnews This is somewhat like a bulletin board operating on each system which is a part of the net Netnews separates contributions into hundreds of different categories based on a group name The groups dealing most closely with space topics are called sci space news sci space sci space shuttle sci astro and talk politics space Contributors post submissions called articles in netnews terminology on their local machine which sends it to other nearby machines Similarly articles sent from nearby machines are stored locally and may be forwarded to other systems so that an article is posted locally and eventually reaches all the Usenet sites interested in receiving the news group to which the article was posted Gateway machines redirect the Usenet sci space group into Internet and BITNET mailing lists and vice versa the other Usenet groups are not accessible as mailing lists If you can receive netnews its more flexible interface and access to a wider range of material usually make it the preferred option MAILING LISTS SPACE Digest is the main Internet list and is now being run by the International Space University in only its second change of management in over a decade Email space

15,norris athena mit writes This is certainly a valid objection to religion as explanation of nature Fortunately for the convenience of us believers there is a class of questions that can never be r ced away by natural science For example why does the universe exist at all Must there be a why to this I ask because of what you also assume about God namely that He just exists with no why to His existence So the question is reversed Why can t we assume the universe just exists as you assume God to just exist Why must there be a why to the universe After all the time space world didn t have to exist Why does anything exist And is it possible for persons e g man to e into being out of a purely impersonal cosmos These questions which look at the real mysteries of life the creation of the world and of persons provide a permanent indicator that the meaning of life in the material world can only be found outside that world in its Source It may be that one day man not only can create life but can also create man Now I don t see this happening in my lifetime nor do I assert it is probable But the possibility is there given scientists are working hard at decoding out genetic code to perhaps help cure disease of a genetic variation Again though must there be why or a divine prupose to man s existence When you say that man is only an animal I have to think that you are presenting an unprovable statement a dogma if you will And one the requires a kind of faith too By taking such a hard line in your atheism you may have stumbled into a religion of your own As far as we can tell man falls into the mammal catagory Now if there were something more to the man say a soul then we have yet to find evidence of such But as it is now man is a mammal babies are born live mother gives milk we re warm blooded etc as other mammals are and is similar in genetic construction to some of them in particular primates For more on this check out talk origins But before you write off all Christianity as phony and shallow I hope you ll do a little research into its history and varieties perhaps by reading Paul Johnson s A History of Christianity From your remarks it seems that you have been exposed to certain types of Christian religion and not others Even an atheist should have enough faith in Man to know that a movement of 2000 years has to have some depth and be animated by some enduring values Well then Buddhism Confucianism Taoism Hinduism Judaism Zoerasterism Shintoism and Islam should fit this bit of logic quite nicely All have depth all have enduring values thus all must be true Stephen Atheist Libertarian Pro individuality Pro responsibility Jr and all that jazz

17, From Center for Policy Research cpr Subject Labour s enclaves policy IMPORTANT Labour s enclaves policy in the occupied territories by Israel Shahak publ in Middle East International London 30 4 93 It is not difficult to discover Israel s policy towards the Palestinians at any given time It can be easily inferred from the facts on the ground and from the information provided by the Hebrew press There is one condition though The torrents of claptrap about the peace process must be totally ignored as must Israel s official pronouncements whole sole purpose is to distort reality By concentrating only on the facts it was early apparent that Labour s policies were no different from those of Shamir but for their greater reliance on deceit and their more effective implementation Likud s policies were accurately described by Ariel Sharon in an article ac panied by a map in Yediot Aharonot last August The Sharon plan envisaged a division of the West Bank into seven and the Gaza Strip into four autonomous Palestinian enclaves all of them under Israeli supervision The total area of these enclaves amounted to about 15 per cent of the territories The rest was to be controlled by the Israeli settlements and the highways built around the enclaves The entire area around Jerusalem from the outskirts of Ramallah to the boundaries of Bethlehem has already been turned into a Greater Jerusalem where the Arab inhabited localities amount to small enclaves surrounded by areas occupied by Israeli settlements or reserved for them Judging from Labour s settlement policy it may be assumed that it may content itself with a lesser number of Arab enclaves of a rather larger size than Sharon had planned But the principle of surrounding the enclaves by settlements strategically dispersed along the highways remains unchanged Labour plans only four enclaves in the West Bank two in Samaria and two in Judea i e north and south of Jerusalem respectively and no more than two in the Gaza Strip In regard to Greater Jerusalem Labour s policies hardly deviate from Sharon s A saner version of Likud policy As some Israeli correspondents at once realised Labour policies were but a saner version of Sharon s extravaganza Last July Gideon Eshet wrote in Yediot Aharonot that while barely a few months ago Labour supported the demand to freeze all construction beyond the Green Line no specific decision to freeze construction in the territories has been taken And Uzi Benziman wrote in Ha aretz that as far as can be judged on the basis of the internal political discussions in Jerusalem Rabin intends to stick to Likud s ways The two biggest enclaves envisaged by Labour are located in Samaria Therefore the belt of settlements around the Trans Samaria Highway designed to separate those enclaves from each other is of paramount importance According to the latest data the percentage of Israeli settlers in the entire West Bank population apart from East Jerusalem is a mere 5 5 per cent But for the area around the Trans Samaria Highway the corresponding figure is almost 20 per cent and it is increasing steadily The situation in the settlements of the Efrat Block south of Jerusalem designed to sever the enclave around Bethlehem from the one around Hebron is pretty much the same The Efrat Block is now being connected with West Jerusalem by a highway The project is costly in the extreme because the highway is designed to bypass Bethlehem by a sequence of long tunnels The final decision to build this highway was suspended until Rabin s return from his US visit in March The subsequent decision to renew its construction can be seen as US approval for the enclaves plan as a whole Process of impoverishment The enclaves plan implies deliberate and steady impoverishment of the Palestinians This is well known in Israel but ignored abroad by all who should be concerned including the PLO In regard to the Gaza Strip the whole process was best described by Ze ev Shiff in Ha aretz in March He mentions having seen a pamphlet issued six years ago by the Civil Administration forecasting the conditions in the Gaza Strip under Israeli rule in 2000 His analysis deserves to be quoted extensively We continue to steal the Strip s water even though its quality deteriorates from year to year We continue to steal the Strip s tiny land resources in order to found there more and more settlements as if we deliberately want to make the inhabitants despair and in their despair think in termws of having nothing to lose It is by our own doing that the Strip s workers must now spend travelling to their workplaces almost as much time as they spend working From the military point of view we have kept control of no more than half the Strip s area at an increasingly exorbitant price in manpower and resources About a year before Moshe Arens left the defence ministry I heard him saying that we should withdraw from the Strip e what may His argument was that Israel sinks into the Strip ever deeper and deeper He told me he had proposed this to Yitzhak Shamir but he rejected it Yitzhak Rabin rejects it too Enormous state support for the Qatif Block settlers can also be cited as proof that the enclaves plan is being implemented The Qatif Block settlements founded by the first Rabin government of 1974 77 are intended to divide the Gaza Strip into two separate enclaves Efraim Davidi of Davar had data showing how vital for Israeli this enterprise is The Qatif Block is now producing 40 per cent of Israeli tomatoes destined for export and a substantial proportion of cut flowers He also deals with the subsidies the settlers receive considerably augmented by the present government Owing to them housing units are cheap The present government does not spare efforts to recruit new settlers to the block Any prospective settler will get a 95 per cent mortgage for his house on top of a grant of 18 000 shekels 6 500 Such data shows that Israel s plans apply whether the Palestinians of the Gaza Strip are allowed or forbidden to work in Israel The economic motivations were explained by Danny Rubinstein in Ha aretz in March From the economic viewpoint Gaza could already be sealed off hermetically and all the Strip s workers could be barred from entering Israel Even though accurate data is hard to e by it is indisputable that during the last two years the numbes of Gazan workers arriving daily to work in Israel has markedly decreased from 80 000 in the mid 80s to 40 000 today But the decrease is not only due to restrictions imposed on entering Israel from Gaza It is also due to the drastic curtailment of demand for Gazan labour in Israel With unemployment in Israel soaring and the construction of apartments blocks virtually halted the workers from Gaza are no longer really needed Gaza s total dependence The entire economy of the Gaza Strip is totally dependent on Israel In recent years in the Gaza Strip there has been an increase in sub contracted work for Israeli factories mostly footware and textiles Thousands of small workshops employing an average of four workers get their raw materials or unfinished products together with detailed working instructions from Israeli factories Rubinstein attributes this development to the fact that the average wage in the Gaza Strip is merely 40 per cent of that in the West Bank which in turn stands at half the average wage in Israel and besides the Gazan employer does not pay any social security for his employees If the average wage in the Gaza Strip is just a fifth of that in Israel the profits of Israeli factories and even of Palestinian sub contractors must be vast They are higher still when a Gazan sub contractor provides labour to be performed at home with the family s help The livelihood of tens of thousands of Gazans depends on such sub contracted work Many of them are women and children paid about ten shekels 3 50 a day which can last 12 hours or more There can be no doubt that profits from exploiting cheap Gazan labour are one of the reasons for the stubborn opposition of Rabin and other Israeli ministers to withdrawal from the Strip Economic conditions in the Gaza Strip differ little from what was created straight after Israel s conquest in 1967 In this respect one should not be deluded by the talk nowadays fashionable about Israeli gestures intended to encourage economic development in the territories As Israeli journalists point out all permits for opening new businesses depend on a prior approval by the Shin Bet Behind all the professed goodwill there is no desire to solve problems just the attitude of a good colonialist willing to do something for the benefit of the natives but on condition that they behave nicely do not be e rebellious and never do anything against the interests of the metropolis its economic interests included wrote Michal Sela in Davar in February The development of sub contracted work in the Gaza Strip accords perfectly with Sela s diagnosis Sela also shows how exactly the economic controls work In all branches of the economy lobbies have been set in motion for purposes of freeing Israeli production from the threat of any Palestinian petition The method is simplicity itself As soon as any Israeli producer succeeds in persuading the government or even the trade and industry minister alone a military order is issued prohibiting the export of a given produce to Israel If this does not suffice a Palestinian factory may be denied a licence to operate or bureaucratic obstacles may paralyse its production Among the most active of such lobbies is the agricultural one It has succeeded in limiting exports of Gazan vegetables except for those grown by settlers not only to Israel but also to Europe where they otherwise might pete with Israeli exports Perpetuaring apartheid Labour s goal is to perpetuate this apartheid regime in the territories The same goal is shared by the US which otherwise could not support the Labour government so firmly In my view one of the reasons the US feels happier about supporting Labour than Likud is its greater efficiency in pursuing the settlement drive This point was brought home by Ofer Shelah in Ma ariv who deplored the settlers failure which he attributed to Likud s inefficiency he showed that the peak yearly settlement growth occured during the term of office of the National Unity government i e 1984 90 in which Rabin served throughout as the defence minister Likud s reputation for settling the territories better than Labour is false attributable to the many tiny settlements without strategic value founded under Shamir for symbolic reasons To sum up Labour s policy unconditionally supported by the US differs from that of Likud primarily in the efficiency with which it is implemented According to that policy the territories are to be divided into two parts The major part is to be ruled by Israel directly and the minor part indirectly In my view this racist scheme is doomed to ultimately fail but at a horrifying price in human suffering The sooner its true nature is recognised the less suffering it may cause

16, Hell a Glock is the last thing that should be switched to The only thing that I know about a Glock is the lack of a real safety on it Sure there is that little thing in the trigger but that isn t too great of a safety You re getting warmer The little thing in the trigger has to be depressed before the trigger can move What this means is the damned thing won t go off until the trigger is pulled This makes it just about there HAVE been some problems but we re assuming the gun is functioning correctly as safe as a revolver The gun when working correctly is totally drop safe Now in police work this is a consideration There is not a single documented case I m aware of where a police officer was killed because he failed to operate the safety on his firearm There are quite a few documented cases where criminals got hold of the cops gun and couldn t figure out how to get the safety off in time to use the gun thus the proprietary nature of the safety to the criminal at least very likely prevented the office from getting shot The purpose of a safety is to make the gun safe from unintentional fire This does not mean it should be so plicated as to slow down intentional use Thus the Glock safety is perfectly adequate from a safety standpoint but not necessarily the most desirable from the standpoint of open carry where it is easily grabbed by somebody else By this criteria it DOES make a lot of sense as a concealed carry piece From the standpoint of police use it is no better or worse than a revolver as far as being proprietary to the officer in the method of firing it The ideal solution may someday be biometric sensing of the user so that the firearm can t be used by anybody but it s owner but for now the wide variety of safety systems helps unless the criminal happens to be familiar with that particular type of firearm Rick

0,Archive name atheism logic Alt atheism archive name logic Last modified 5 April 1993 Version 1 4 Constructing a Logical Argument Although there is much argument on Usenet the general quality of argument found is poor This article attempts to provide a gentle introduction to logic in the hope of improving the general level of debate Logic is the science of reasoning proof thinking or inference Concise OED Logic allows us to analyze a piece of reasoning and determine whether it is correct or not valid or invalid Of course one does not need to study logic in order to reason correctly nevertheless a little basic knowledge of logic is often helpful when constructing or analyzing an argument Note that no claim is being made here about whether logic is universally applicable The matter is very much open for debate This document merely explains how to use logic given that you have already decided that logic is the right tool for the job Propositions or statements are the building blocks of a logical argument A proposition is a statement which is either true or false for example It is raining or Today is Tuesday Propositions may be either asserted said to be true or denied said to be false Note that this is a technical meaning of deny not the everyday meaning The proposition is the meaning of the statement not the particular arrangement of words used to express it So God exists and There exists a God both express the same proposition An argument is to quote the Monty Python sketch a connected series of statements to establish a definite proposition An argument consists of three stages First of all the propositions which are necessary for the argument to continue are stated These are called the premises of the argument They are the evidence or reasons for accepting the argument and its conclusions Premises or assertions are often indicated by phrases such as because since obviously and so on The phrase obviously is often viewed with suspicion as it can be used to intimidate others into accepting suspicious premises If something doesn t seem obvious to you don t be afraid to question it You can always say Oh yes you re right it is obvious when you ve heard the explanation Next the premises are used to derive further propositions by a process known as inference In inference one proposition is arrived at on the basis of one or more other propositions already accepted There are various forms of valid inference The propositions arrived at by inference may then be used in further inference Inference is often denoted by phrases such as implies that or therefore Finally we arrive at the conclusion of the argument the proposition which is affirmed on the basis of the premises and inference Conclusions are often indicated by phrases such as therefore it follows that we conclude and so on The conclusion is often stated as the final stage of inference For example Every event has a cause premise The universe has a beginning premise All beginnings involve an event premise This implies that the beginning of the universe involved an event inference Therefore the universe has a cause inference and conclusion Note that the conclusion of one argument might be a premise in another argument A proposition can only be called a premise or a conclusion with respect to a particular argument the terms do not make sense in isolation Sometimes an argument will not follow the order given above for example the conclusions might be stated first and the premises stated afterwards in support of the conclusion This is perfectly valid if sometimes a little confusing Recognizing an argument is much harder than recognizing premises or conclusions Many people shower their writing with assertions without ever producing anything which one might reasonably describe as an argument Some statements look like arguments but are not For example If the Bible is accurate Jesus must either have been insane an evil liar or the Son of God This is not an argument it is a conditional statement It does not assert the premises which are necessary to support what appears to be its conclusion It also suffers from a number of other logical flaws but we ll e to those later Another example God created you therefore do your duty to God The phrase do your duty to God is not a proposition since it is neither true nor false Therefore it is not a conclusion and the sentence is not an argument Finally causality is important Consider a statement of the form A because B If we re interested in establishing A and B is offered as evidence the statement is an argument If we re trying to establish the truth of B then it is not an argument it is an explanation For example There must be something wrong with the engine of my car because it will not start This is an argument My car will not start because there is something wrong with the engine This is an explanation There are two traditional types of argument d ctive and inductive A d ctive argument is one which provides conclusive proof of its conclusions that is an argument where if the premises are true the conclusion must also be true A d ctive argument is either valid or invalid A valid argument is defined as one where if the premises are true then the conclusion is true An inductive argument is one where the premises provide some evidence for the truth of the conclusion Inductive arguments are not valid or invalid however we can talk about whether they are better or worse than other arguments and about how probable their premises are There are forms of argument in ordinary language which are neither d ctive nor inductive However we will concentrate for the moment on d ctive arguments as they are often viewed as the most rigorous and convincing It is important to note that the fact that a d ctive argument is valid does not imply that its conclusion holds This is because of the slightly counter intuitive nature of implication which we must now consider more carefully Obviously a valid argument can consist of true propositions However an argument may be entirely valid even if it contains only false propositions For example All insects have wings premise Woodlice are insects premise Therefore woodlice have wings conclusion Here the conclusion is not true because the argument s premises are false If the argument s premises were true however the conclusion would be true The argument is thus entirely valid More subtly we can reach a true conclusion from one or more false premises as in All fish live in the sea premise Dolphins are fish premise Therefore dolphins live in the sea conclusion However the one thing we cannot do is reach a false conclusion through valid inference from true premises We can therefore draw up a truth table for implication The symbol denotes implication A is the premise B the conclusion T and F represent true and false respectively Premise Conclusion Inference A B A B F F T If the premises are false and the inference F T T valid the conclusion can be true or false T F F If the premises are true and the conclusion false the inference must be invalid T T T If the premises are true and the inference valid the conclusion must be true A sound argument is a valid argument whose premises are true A sound argument therefore arrives at a true conclusion Be careful not to confuse valid arguments with sound arguments To delve further into the structure of logical arguments would require lengthy discussion of linguistics and philosophy It is simpler and probably more useful to summarize the major pitfalls to be avoided when constructing an argument These pitfalls are known as fallacies In everyday English the term fallacy is used to refer to mistaken beliefs as well as to the faulty reasoning that leads to those beliefs This is fair enough but in logic the term is generally used to refer to a form of technically incorrect argument especially if the argument appears valid or convincing So for the purposes of this discussion we define a fallacy as a logical argument which appears to be correct but which can be seen to be incorrect when examined more closely By studying fallacies we aim to avoid being misled by them The following list of fallacies is not intended to be exhaustive ARGUMENTUM AD BACULUM APPEAL TO FORCE The Appeal to Force is mitted when the arguer resorts to force or the threat of force in order to try and push the acceptance of a conclusion It is often used by politicians and can be summarized as might makes right The force threatened need not be a direct threat from the arguer For example Thus there is ample proof of the truth of the Bible All those who refuse to accept that truth will burn in Hell ARGUMENTUM AD HOMINEM Argumentum ad hominem is literally argument directed at the man The Abusive variety of Argumentum ad Hominem occurs when instead of trying to disprove the truth of an assertion the arguer attacks the person or people making the assertion This is invalid because the truth of an assertion does not depend upon the goodness of those asserting it For example Atheism is an evil philosophy It is practised by Communists and murderers Sometimes in a court of law doubt is cast upon the testimony of a witness by showing for example that he is a known perjurer This is a valid way of r cing the credibility of the testimony given by the witness and not argumentum ad hominem however it does not demonstrate that the witness s testimony is false To conclude otherwise is to fall victim of the Argumentum ad Ignorantiam see elsewhere in this list The circumstantial form of Argumentum ad Hominem is mitted when a person argues that his opponent ought to accept the truth of an assertion because of the opponent s particular circumstances For example It is perfectly acceptable to kill animals for food How can you argue otherwise when you re quite happy to wear leather shoes This is an abusive charge of inconsistency used as an excuse for dismissing the opponent s argument This fallacy can also be used as a means of rejecting a conclusion For example Of course you would argue that positive discrimination is a bad thing You re white This particular form of Argumentum ad Hominem when one alleges that one s adversary is rationalizing a conclusion formed from selfish interests is also known as poisoning the well ARGUMENTUM AD IGNORANTIUM Argumentum ad ignorantium means argument from ignorance This fallacy occurs whenever it is argued that something must be true simply because it has not been proved false Or equivalently when it is argued that something must be false because it has not been proved true Note that this is not the same as assuming that something is false until it has been proved true a basic scientific principle Examples Of course the Bible is true Nobody can prove otherwise Of course telepathy and other psychic phenomena do not exist Nobody has shown any proof that they are real Note that this fallacy does not apply in a court of law where one is generally assumed innocent until proven guilty Also in scientific investigation if it is known that an event would produce certain evidence of its having occurred the absence of such evidence can validly be used to infer that the event did not occur For example A flood as described in the Bible would require an enormous volume of water to be present on the earth The earth does not have a tenth as much water even if we count that which is frozen into ice at the poles Therefore no such flood occurred In science we can validly assume from lack of evidence that something has not occurred We cannot conclude with certainty that it has not occurred however ARGUMENTUM AD MISERICORDIAM This is the Appeal to Pity also known as Special Pleading The fallacy is mitted when the arguer appeals to pity for the sake of getting a conclusion accepted For example I did not murder my mother and father with an axe Please don t find me guilty I m suffering enough through being an orphan ARGUMENTUM AD POPULUM This is known as Appealing to the Gallery or Appealing to the People To mit this fallacy is to attempt to win acceptance of an assertion by appealing to a large group of people This form of fallacy is often characterized by emotive language For example Pornography must be banned It is violence against women The Bible must be true Millions of people know that it is Are you trying to tell them that they are all mistaken fools ARGUMENTUM AD NUMERAM This fallacy is closely related to the argumentum ad populum It consists of asserting that the more people who support or believe a proposition the more likely it is that that proposition is correct ARGUMENTUM AD VERECUNDIAM The Appeal to Authority uses the admiration of the famous to try and win support for an assertion For example Isaac Newton was a genius and he believed in God This line of argument is not always pletely bogus for example reference to an admitted authority in a particular field may be relevant to a discussion of that subject For example we can distinguish quite clearly between Stephen Hawking has concluded that black holes give off radiation and John Searle has concluded that it is impossible to build an intelligent puter Hawking is a physicist and so we can reasonably expect his opinions on black hole radiation to be informed Searle is a linguist so it is questionable whether he is well qualified to speak on the subject of machine intelligence THE FALLACY OF ACCIDENT The Fallacy of Accident is mitted when a general rule is applied to a particular case whose accidental circumstances mean that the rule is inapplicable It is the error made when one goes from the general to the specific For example Christians generally dislike atheists You are a Christian so you must dislike atheists This fallacy is often mitted by moralists and legalists who try to decide every moral and legal question by mechanically applying general rules CONVERSE ACCIDENT HASTY GENERALIZATION This fallacy is the reverse of the fallacy of accident It occurs when one forms a general rule by examining only a few specific cases which are not representative of all possible cases For example Jim Bakker was an insincere Christian Therefore all Christians are insincere SWEEPING GENERALIZATION DICTO SIMPLICITER A sweeping generalization occurs when a general rule is applied to a particular situation in which the features of that particular situation render the rule inapplicable A sweeping generalization is the opposite of a hasty generalization NON CAUSA PRO CAUSA POST HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC These are known as False Cause fallacies The fallacy of Non Causa Pro Causa occurs when one identifies something as the cause of an event but it has not actually been shown to be the cause For example I took an aspirin and prayed to God and my headache disappeared So God cured me of the headache The fallacy of Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc occurs when something is assumed to be the cause of an event merely because it happened before the event For example The Soviet Union collapsed after taking up atheism Therefore we must avoid atheism for the same reasons CUM HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC This fallacy is similar to post hoc ergo propter hoc It asserts that because two events occur together they must be causally related and leaves no room for other factors that may be the cause s of the events PETITIO PRINCIPII This fallacy occurs when the premises are at least as questionable as the conclusion reached CIRCULUS IN DEMONSTRANDO This fallacy occurs when one assumes as a premise the conclusion which one wishes to reach Often the proposition will be rephrased so that the fallacy appears to be a valid argument For example Homosexuals must not be allowed to hold government office Hence any government official who is revealed to be a homosexual will lose his job Therefore homosexuals will do anything to hide their secret and will be open to blackmail Therefore homosexuals cannot be allowed to hold government office Note that the argument is entirely circular the premise is the same as the conclusion An argument like the above has actually been cited as the reason for the British Secret Services official ban on homosexual employees Another example is the classic We know that God exists because the Bible tells us so And we know that the Bible is true because it is the word of God COMPLEX QUESTION FALLACY OF INTERROGATION This is the Fallacy of Presupposition One example is the classic loaded question Have you stopped beating your wife The question presupposes a definite answer to another question which has not even been asked This trick is often used by lawyers in cross examination when they ask questions like Where did you hide the money you stole Similarly politicians often ask loaded questions such as How long will this EC interference in our affairs be allowed to continue or Does the Chancellor plan two more years of ruinous privatization IGNORATIO ELENCHI The fallacy of Irrelevant Conclusion consists of claiming that an argument supports a particular conclusion when it is actually logically nothing to do with that conclusion For example a Christian may begin by saying that he will argue that the teachings of Christianity are undoubtably true If he then argues at length that Christianity is of great help to many people no matter how well he argues he will not have shown that Christian teachings are true Sadly such fallacious arguments are often successful because they arouse emotions which cause others to view the supposed conclusion in a more favourable light EQUIVOCATION Equivocation occurs when a key word is used with two or more different meanings in the same argument For example What could be more affordable than free software But to make sure that it remains free that users can do what they like with it we must place a license on it to make sure that will always be freely redistributable AMPHIBOLY Amphiboly occurs when the premises used in an argument are ambiguous because of careless or ungrammatical phrasing ACCENT Accent is another form of fallacy through shifting meaning In this case the meaning is changed by altering which parts of a statement are emphasized For example consider We should not speak ILL of our friends and We should not speak ill of our FRIENDS FALLACIES OF COMPOSITION One fallacy of position is to conclude that a property shared by the parts of something must apply to the whole For example The bicycle is made entirely of low mass ponents and is therefore very lightweight The other fallacy of position is to conclude that a property of a number of individual items is shared by a collection of those items For example A car uses less petrol and causes less pollution than a bus Therefore cars are less environmentally damaging than buses FALLACY OF DIVISION The fallacy of division is the opposite of the fallacy of position Like its opposite it exists in two varieties The first is to assume that a property of some thing must apply to its parts For example You are studying at a rich college Therefore you must be rich The other is to assume that a property of a collection of items is shared by each item For example Ants can destroy a tree Therefore this ant can destroy a tree THE SLIPPERY SLOPE ARGUMENT This argument states that should one event occur so will other harmful events There is no proof made that the harmful events are caused by the first event For example If we legalize marijuana then we would have to legalize crack and heroin and we ll have a nation full of drug addicts on welfare Therefore we cannot legalize marijuana A IS BASED ON B FALLACIES IS A TYPE OF FALLACIES These fallacies occur when one attempts to argue that things are in some way similar without actually specifying in what way they are similar Examples Isn t history based upon faith If so then isn t the Bible also a form of history Islam is based on faith Christianity is based on faith so isn t Islam a form of Christianity Cats are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry dogs are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry so aren t dogs a form of cat AFFIRMATION OF THE CONSEQUENT This fallacy is an argument of the form A implies B B is true therefore A is true To understand why it is a fallacy examine the truth table for implication given earlier DENIAL OF THE ANTECEDENT This fallacy is an argument of the form A implies B A is false therefore B is false Again the truth table for implication makes it clear why this is a fallacy Note that this fallacy is different from Non Causa Pro Causa the latter has the form A implies B A is false therefore B is false where A does NOT in fact imply B at all Here the problem is not that the implication is invalid rather it is that the falseness of A does not allow us to d ce anything about B CONVERTING A CONDITIONAL This fallacy is an argument of the form If A then B therefore if B then A ARGUMENTUM AD ANTIQUITAM This is the fallacy of asserting that something is right or good simply because it is old or because that s the way it s always been ARGUMENTUM AD NOVITAM This is the opposite of the argumentum ad antiquitam it is the fallacy of asserting that something is more correct simply because it is new or newer than something else ARGUMENTUM AD CRUMENAM The fallacy of believing that money is a criterion of correctness that those with more money are more likely to be right ARGUMENTUM AD LAZARUM The fallacy of assuming that because someone is poor he or she is sounder or more virtuous than one who is wealthier This fallacy is the opposite of the argumentum ad crumenam ARGUMENTUM AD NAUSEAM This is the incorrect belief that an assertion is more likely to be true the more often it is heard An argumentum ad nauseum is one that employs constant repetition in asserting something BIFURCATION Also referred to as the black and white fallacy bifurcation occurs when one presents a situation as having only two alternatives where in fact other alternatives exist or can exist PLURIUM INTERROGATIONUM MANY QUESTIONS This fallacy occurs when a questioner demands a simple answer to a plex question NON SEQUITUR A non sequitur is an argument where the conclusion is drawn from premises which are not logically connected with it RED HERRING This fallacy is mitted when irrelevant material is introduced to the issue being discussed so that everyone s attention is diverted away from the points being made towards a different conclusion REIFICATION HYPOSTATIZATION Reification occurs when an abstract concept is treated as a concrete thing SHIFTING THE BURDEN OF PROOF The burden of proof is always on the person making an assertion or proposition Shifting the burden of proof a special case of argumentum ad ignorantium is the fallacy of putting the burden of proof on the person who denies or questions the assertion being made The source of the fallacy is the assumption that something is true unless proven otherwise STRAW MAN The straw man fallacy is to misrepresent someone else s position so that it can be attacked more easily then to knock down that misrepresented position then to conclude that the original position has been demolished It is a fallacy because it fails to deal with the actual arguments that have been made THE EXTENDED ANALOGY The fallacy of the Extended Analogy often occurs when some suggested general rule is being argued over The fallacy is to assume that mentioning two different situations in an argument about a general rule constitutes a claim that those situations are analogous to each other This fallacy is best explained using a real example from a debate about anti cryptography legislation I believe it is always wrong to oppose the law by breaking it Such a position is odious it implies that you would not have supported Martin Luther King Are you saying that cryptography legislation is as important as the struggle for Black liberation How dare you TU QUOQUE This is the famous you too fallacy It occurs when an action is argued to be acceptable because the other party has performed it For instance You re just being randomly abusive So You ve been abusive too

16,Relay of coverage seen There was a press conference by authorities at the pound on CNN earlier today Wednesday It was explained that two news photographers were found on the pound earlier this morning without permission It was explained to the press corps that this is dangerous and that an unknown photographer turning around with a long lens camera could be mistaken for someone dangerous by a Texas Ranger surveying the site The two photographers were said to be currently in jail and the press were warned to follow the authorities guidelines It was also emphasized that the survey of the crime scene at this point was crucial and that the press could not be allowed to interfere The press will not be allowed in until the bodies are removed and the site has been pletely surveyed for evidence for a court case That is the gist of the beginning of the conference to the best of my memory I bring this up because I haven t seen anyone else note it and I haven t seen the regular newscasts mention it It will probably be mentioned in the papers tomorrow My opinions I find this disturbing While I believe that Koresh is largely responsible for not ending this standoff in a peacable manner during the last 51 days of patient opportunity I find the secrecy surrounding the aftermath more damaging to the authorities position than they realize Since the vast majority of potential defendents in a court case are already dead the emphasis on the importance of building the court case seems overblown to me It will be interesting to see the hearings on this affair I have also heard congressional calls for a review and possible overhaul of government enforcement agencies which you will recall I have stated would be a good idea in previous months Please also note that I by no means endorse or agree with the many conspiracy type theories I have read here and in other groups As usual I am basing my opinions on info gathered from various media and filtered by my own mon sense and consideration of plausibility IMHO As such my opinion is subject to change as more information is made available Scott Roby Standard Disclaimer

take a break every so often The better ones also include advice on exercises posture and workstation setup Some use sound hardware to warn of a break others use beeps or screen messages Often RSI appears only after many years of typing and the pain has a delayed action in the short term too frequently you can be typing all day with little problem and the pain gets worse in the evening These tools act as an early warning system by listening to their warnings and taking breaks with exercises you don t have to wait for your body to give you a more serious and painful warning that is getting

Includes At Your Service Tool Computer Health Break mercial software Available from Escape Ergonomics Inc 1111 W El Camino Real Suite 109 Mailstop 403 Sunnyvale CA Tel 1 408 730 8410 Platforms DOS Description Aimed at preventing RSI this program warns you to take breaks after a configurable interval based on clock time or after a set number of keystrokes whichever is earlier It gives you 3 exercises to do each time randomly selected from a set of 70 Exercises are apparently tuned to the type of work you do data entry word processing information processing Exercises are illustrated and include quite a lot of text on how to do the exercise and on what exactly the exercise does CHB includes hypertext information on RSI that you can use to learn more about RSI and how to prevent it Other information on non RSI topics can be plugged into this hypertext viewer A full glossary of medical terms and jargon is included CHB can be run in a DOS box under Windows but does not then warn you when to take a break it does not therefore appear useful when used with Windows Cost 79 95 quantity discounts site licenses Comments The keystroke counting approach looks good it seems better to measure the activity that is causing you problems than to measure clock time or even typing time The marketing stuff is very good and includes some summaries of research papers as well as lots of arguments you can use to get your pany to pay up for RSI management tools Tool EyerCise mercial software Available from RAN Enterprises One Woodland Park Dr Haverhill MA 01830 US Tel 800 451 4487 US

use Cost 69 95 including shipping and handling quantity discounts for resellers Free demo 5 outside US Comments I have a copy of this and it works as advertised I would say it is better for RSI prevention than RSI management because it does not allow breaks at periods less than 30 minutes Also it interrupts you based on clock time rather than typing time which is not so helpful unless you use the keyboard all day Worked OK on Windows 3 0 though it did occasionally crash with a UAE not sure why Also refused to work with the space bar on one PC and has one window without window controls

have had a play with this and it works OK Its user interface design is much better in 2 0 though still a bit unusual expensive tool around and it does the job It is also the only tool with a redistributable demo so if you do get the demo post it on your local bulletin boards FTP servers and Bitnet servers Does not include general info on RSI and ergonomics but it does have the ability to step backward in the exercise sequence which is good for repeating the most helpful exercises Tool Typewatch freeware version 3 8 October 1992 Available from Email to richardd hoskyns co uk Anonymous ftp soda berkeley pub typing injury typewatch shar Platforms UNIX tested on SCO SunOS Mach character and X Window mode Description This is a shell script that runs in the background and warns you to stop typing based on how long you have been continuously typing It does not provide exercises but it does check that you really do take a break and tells you when you can start typing again Typewatch now tells you how many minutes you have been typing today each time it warns you which is useful so you know how much you really type It also logs information to a file that you can analyse or simply print out The warning message appears on your screen in character mode in a pop up window for X Windows or as a Zephyr message for those with Athena stuff Tim Freeman tsf cs cmu has put in a lot of bug fixes extra features and support for X Zephyr and Mach Not formally supported but email richardd hoskyns co uk for SCO SunOS character mode or tsf cs cmu for Mach X Window mode Zephyr if you have problems or want to give feedback Tool Various calendar batch queue programs Available from Various sources Platforms Various Description Any calendar reminder program that warns you of an up ing appointment can be turned into an ad hoc RSI management tool Or any batch queue submission program that lets you submit a program to run at a specific time to display a message to the screen Using Windows as an example create a Calendar file and include this filename in your WIN INI s load line so you get it on every startup of Windows Suppose you want to have breaks every 30 minutes starting from 9 am Press F7 Special Time to enter an appointment enter 9 30 hit Enter and type some text in saying what the break is for Then press F5 to set an alarm on this entry and repeat for the next appointment By using Windows Recorder you can record the keystrokes that set up breaks throughout a day in a REC file Put this file on your run line as above and you will then with a single keypress be able to set up your daily appointments with RSI exercises The above method should be adaptable to most calendar programs An example using batch jobs would be to submit a simple job that runs at 9 30 am and warns you to take a break this will depend a lot on your operating system While these approaches are not ideal they are a good way of forcing yourself to take a break if you can t get hold of a suitable RSI management tool If you are techie enough you might want to write a version of Typewatch see above for your operating system using batch jobs or whatever fits best Tool Digital watches with count down timers Available from Various sources e g Casio BP 100 Description Many digital watches have timers that count down from a settable number of minutes they usually reset easily to that number either manually or automatically While these are a very basic tool they are very useful if you are writing reading driving or doing anything away from a puter which can still cause or aggravate RSI The great advantage is that they remind you to break from whatever you are doing Comments My own experience was that cutting down a lot on my typing led to my writing a lot more and still reading as much as ever which actually aggravated the RSI in my right arm though the left arm improved Getting a count down timer watch has been very useful on some occasions where I write a lot in a day I have tried an old fashioned hour glass type egg timer but these are not much good because they do not give an audible warning of the end of the time period KEYBOARD REMAPPING TOOLS these enable you to change your keyboard mapping so you can type one handedly or with a different two handed layout One handed typing tools may help but be VERY careful about how you use them if you keep the same overall typing workload you are simply doubling your hand use for the hand that you use for typing and may therefore make matters worse Tool hsh public domain Available from Anonymous ftp soda berkeley pub typing injury hsh shar Platforms UNIX don t know which ones Description Allows one handed typing and other general keyboard remappings Only works through tty s so you can use it with a terminal or an xterm but not most X programs Tool Dvorak keyboard tools various Available from Anonymous ftp soda berkeley pub typing injury xdvorak c Also built into Windows 3 x Description The Dvorak keyboard apparently uses a more rational layout that involves more balanced hand use It may help prevent RSI a bit but you can also use it if you have RSI since it will slow down your typing a

15,Dear fellow Christians I had a dinner last night with a bible study group which I am in We had a discussion about the difference between Christianity and Islam And I was shocked to hear that our bible study teacher said that Mohammad was indeed a prophet but of Satan I said What I did not believe that because I have some moslem friends who are so kind and nice even sometimes I feel I wish I could be like them in my point of view they don t sin as much as I do How e if they were under Satan they could have such personalities To tell you the truth I don t know much about Islam But I know that they believe in God they believe in the day of judgement Now I m asking you what your opinions about Islam and its teaching IMPORTANT I do not want to discuss whether they are saved or not I do not want to discuss about politic related to Islam P S I post this in bit listserv christia soc religion christian and bit listserv catholic In Christ our Lord Smile Jesus loves you Tabut Torsina TORSINA ENUXHB EAS ASU EDU Let me start by saying that this is not the right newsgroup for a discussion of Islam since there s a group for that But I suspect the point your teacher was making was not specifically about Islam Indeed it s going to be impossible to see what he was getting at within your groundrules since the question of whether non Christians are saved is at the heart of it The classic Christian view which I think most people believed until the last century or so was that Christianity and of course Judaism was the only religion founded by God and that all other religions worshipped false gods and came from Satan This is more or less a corollary of another traditional view that no one but Christians and possibly Jews will be saved This need not mean that there s no truth in any other religion nor that all of their members are intentionally Satanic After all in order to be an effective snare Satanic alternatives would have to be attractive Thus they might contain all kinds of truth wisdom and spiritual insights They would be missing only one thing knowledge of salvation through Christ If this is the background of your teacher s remarks and I suspect it is that means that a discussion of Islam is not necessarily relevant The point is not that there s anything intrinsically wrong with it It may teach a fine code of behavior and its practitioners may all be wonderful people But if salvation requires being a follower of Christ it could still be a Satanic invention This is a reasonable d ction from the classic Protestant position Christianity says that salvation isn t a matter of being kind and nice Those are good things and we should encourage them But no one is able to do them enough to be saved Salvation requires Christ Please f ive me for doing this in Protestant terms There s a Catholic equivalent to this that has similar implications but in different terms A religion may be quite attractive in all visible ways But if it doesn t have Christ it s like a diet that consists of food that looks wonderful tastes great but is missing some essential food element so that you end up dying Let me be clear that I am not specifically advocating this position What I m trying to do is as usual to clarify issues Indeed it is now relatively un mon for Christians to believe that all other religions are Satanic Most Christians regard such beliefs as an unfortunate vestige of the past This is part of a general move within Christianity in the last century or so to a non judgemental God Christians now find it hard to believe that God would allow anybody other than a really rotten person to end up in hell and they find it hard to envision that real malignant spiritual forces are at work in the world doing things like creating superficially attractive alternatives to Christianity Whether there is actually a sound basis for the shift is a decision that people need to make for themselves clh

1,I m working on a system which uses a given set of 3D key frame positions x y z to control an imaginary camera movement I m using Kochanek Bartels splines as described in the SIGGRAPH 84 proceedings to create a variable number of inbetweens between the key frames I want the inbetweens to be given in the form x y z dx dy dz where the last three argumentsa are the x y and z ponent of the viewing direction vector of the camera when positioned at x y z The method presented by Kochanek and Bartels only deals with the positions of the inbetween view points to be generated I ve tried to set the viewing direction at a view point equal to the chord between the two adjacent view points which in general are not key frames but this causes a sligt discontinuity of the viewing direction vector at the key frame positions although the spatial movement seems to work fine and I m quite certain I think that I ve not simply made an implementation error Now I wonder if anyone out there has used this spline form for similar purposes and how they decided the viewing vectors I d appreciate replies to be emailed to me at iharkest lise unit no Anyone else interested in the answer will be sent a summary of the replies if they contact me N G E A R K E S T A D iharkest lise unit no Comp Sc NTH Norwegian Institute of Technology Some people play hard to get I play hard to want Ford Fairlane

people including innocent kids died today It s amazing how everyone automatically blames one side or the other One thing for sure Koresh will have no chance to defend himself against the statements lacking in fact or COurt sponsored verification made by agents who participated in the situation that killed him I don t know they murdered him I also don t know that the Branch Davidians set a fire and suicidede It is SICK of BATF or FBI spokepeople to make such ments in advance of forensic pathology Stephen thank you God speed No Kinda numb I thought something like this was going to happen over a week ago One of the things that s been obvious from the Yah start is that when there are two armed camps neither of which yields it s usually get slaughtered when any little spark sets it off Which is why Koresh and pany shouldn t have stockpiled weapons and why the BATF shouldn t have e primed for a raid BINGO Am I the only one to notice a No peaceful attempt to serve a warrant b Six months to develop a scene and six days to end it c ah God 25 children at least 64 adults plus 6 at the beginning and more BATF agents all dead Painful point 1 If the Davidians fired first why were the BATF on the roof rather than taking cover Has anyone asked themselves these questions 1 Have you seen the ENTIRE video sequences taken during the opening rounds I seem to recall missing several key parts a The first five minutes of day one only the shooting part es out b What happened to the Feds video units You mean they do not carry helmet cams Wonder why not 2 How is it you can have camera crews with live transmission video present and NOT have an uninterrupted record a You realize the units carry ittle bitty 8mm backups That hold 90 minutes per unit And there are twounits on the professional handhelds so no tape turnover gaps b Until all views are seen it is premature to point fingers in either direction As you well point out Stephen Anyone BATF BD X BD Other could have touched it off by mistake or maliciously More on this below Once Koresh was shot disregarding his being a religious leader and apocalyptically obsessed most likely the people inside just went on drill Just like the BATF outside Is the lesson that automatic responses are very hazardous last resort measures Yes But it is so hard toremain human under the full pressure of hazard game playing and life Painful point 2 Either side could have backed off to help defuse the situation We see the problem constantly here on the net with flaming Ego problems Nuff said More to the point when someone dies almost like it was intended that way both sides will kill to maintain their innocence a contradiction in terms Painful point 3 It doesn t help to take sides in such a situation Just adds fuel to the fire Better is to let it burn out on it s own True Usually I pick the unpopular side and point out from the evidence seen what might have alternatively happened Best example I can think of is Christ with the tax coin He didn t have one and so didn t sanction the Roman authority unduly When they showed it to him he noted that it was Caesar s minting and so said give it to him no waste of time And then he got back to more worthwhile concerns God s will This requires someone interested in God s Will Please note that the outstanding overt problem in this country today is one where the Government wants Caesar s coin to pay off the debt The anti tax movement of today and the anti ssan as i d groups would do well to note who the issuing authority is Ditto for those Yes The AMerican People Not the Federal Government ANd if it is not spent towards that end no one deserves the coin made in the image of God Yah Fewpeople hear the contradiction Money made in the image of God No need to stir things up in ever larger revo revo revolution as governments turn over and over and over I wish you were wrong Many pundits are saying 3 years The onyl good thing to e out of my divorce and my exposure to the Damned pardon me American Divorce Attorney is I have no money left to lose to taxes or inflation painful point 4 For many this was just entertainment Thumbs up Thumbs down Just another thriller like Terminator 2 or a good old ball game Is the lesson that we ve be e jaded to media reality 25 children dead If anyone thinks blaming Koresh or the BATF helps this any at all is sick and wrong The reason you can tell that the BATF may not be entirely straight on this is that the leaders at press conferences havew made ANY ments about even the POSSIBILITY that Koresh or his followers caused this The BATF agentss are more concerned with their repuations and morals not my fault Koresh did it than they are with 25 dead children Same goes for Koresh his followers who are all mostly dead Painful point 5 LA burned The Davidians burned In one case society has abandoned the people which has returned to a frontier In the other the outskirts were bumping against the suburbs Is the lesson that what s lawful in different areas of society depends more on conditions than laws More on power and favoritism My personal opinion Look to history whenever privilege has replaced whatever token of objective law and justice a society has had Hitlerrs have followed If we don t learn the lessons or at least make an honest effort the next conflagration will no doubt be closer to home Rather than putting out fires aren t there much more important concerns for us to work on You do your name sake proud Stephen Its hard but please keep on keeping on each voice in the wilderness now will save a generation unborn from horror Kent who can t cheers today exactly What keeps me from being a bomb thrower is my loving God as irra tional as that is for so many One direct benefit is being able to keep things in perspective KS The day I need a gun or abomb to protect myself in this society is the day that society is already beyond redemption and that aint r ndant if you have any Christian belief aytall and the day that I cannot peacefully enjoin others in the act that Thoreau called Civil Disobedience to rectify the wrongs that my society practises without undue harm or punishment befalling me is the day that society has ceased to be a human society and be e a society of animals We are very cclose to that Such as who hurts more the ones who died or the loved ones who are left Besides the lessons It s also time for many to grieve Including those who ve lost their faith in others or in God I m learning to be patient and let things heal God willing Six years fighting an unjust COurt issue still struggling to be patient For those who like contrary questions NB I was not there I am not a Branch Davidian nor a law official hater I do hate liars or the six letter variety of same The official side has its advocates already lets balance the equation and asj a few questions on the other side for the sake of an old saw the BATF abd FBI seem to want to bypass innocent until proven guilty not innocent until presumed guilty 1 Where are the video tapes from the tanks ALL of them Don t tell me they do not exist They are standard equipment 2 So you think Koresh fired the place because of the explosion a Tear gas es with an aerosol to spread it This aerosol is DELIBERATELY made to be as non flammable as possible It is as non flammable as possible gotcha when in isolation from other substances WHy was a pipe deliveryu system used rather than remote launchers WHy did the FBI not announce this window blown in plus tear gas five minutes then the wall e down and maintain a left to right sequence b Most aerosols also have a secondary pound that when mixed in be es a VERY flammable and difficult to trace suspension with a VERY special property exposure to brief eruptions of high heat muzzle blasts or long exposure to low heat matches a stove will NOT tend to ignite What other chemicals e up in the forensics Who else will be allowed to test the site c After a few minutes to hours ifdesired the bnation rate can be controlled as desired the mixture can be made to be e veryignitable onb exposure to a temperature above a certain point a tracer round for a certain heat quantity a small explosive charge or for a length of time start a wall fire and wait Check your military records look at the tapes Why were tanks large capacity delivey systems tear gas why not somnorifics and now why the hurry was there still a m channel open to the outside Do you see any trace of fire ing BACK to the pound in the videos ALL the videos Which ones are missing Do I sound paranoid Maybe Am I Probably not You trust the FBI and BATF to render judgement IN advance of a Court God help us For we are surely not helping ourselves You trut the Federal Gevernment to give us a clean slate You are 4 3 trillion admitted down and counting Look again Did it happen that way I do not know I was not there AND IT SHOULD WAIT FOR A COURT TO DECIDE But will that happen 89 people will
